# Travel_France
The goal of our project is to create a graphical interface using Python that displays the different travel times between two cities in France (among the 200 largest cities). To do this, we will scrape data from the Rome2Rio website, and we will include a chatbot on our site in case users need additional information. A more advanced version of our project could include not only transportation options, but also hotels and activities to do in the destination city.
