# Travel_France
The objective of our project is to create a graphical interface that summarizes the different means of transportation available from city A to city B among the 200 largest French cities.
To achieve this, we scraped data from the RomeToRio website and then added a chatbot to our application to make it more complex.
The final version of our project can be found in the application.py file.

This project was carried out by Aur√©lien Bresson, Dalia Azzoug, and Lenny Lepetit.
